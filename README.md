A game library that is built on OpenGL. Currently it uses glew and glfw to make things easier.

Bifrost is name of the library, I am also trying to develop an open world game with randomly generating corrent, which is called Valhalla.

It is far from completed, I am trying to develop the game and the library at the same time. Currently wrote a vector and matrix library, basics of the engine (such as input handling, time helpers etc) also wrote another layer on OpenGL to make things easier in the game size (camera, shader, vertex/index buffers, texture helpers). I am not trying to disconnect OpenGL from the game completely though, just making things easier.
